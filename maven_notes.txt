# basics

create a basic pom.xml
- only using properties

# clean - removes target folder and class or jars
mvn clean

# package - creates target folder and jars
mvn package

nothing is created if not a proper folder structure

# always folder structure as:
src/main/java
src/test/java

src/main/resources
src/test/resources

# clean and package at the same time
mvn clean package

- add dependencies in pom.xml
- however, dependent jars are only used in compile time
- not included in the final fat jar of the application jar

------

- build a maven project in intellij without using archetype
- use the side blotter Maven -> Lifecycle to clean and package
- IntelliJ Build project at top pane should not be used
