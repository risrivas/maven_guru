# basics

create a basic pom.xml

mvn --version

# clean - removes target/ and class or jars
mvn clean

# package - creates target/ and jars
mvn package

# always folder structure as:
src/main/java
src/test/java

src/main/resources
src/test/resources

# clean and package at the same time
mvn clean package

# add dependencies in pom.xml
# however, dependent jars are only used in compile time
# not included in the final fat jar of the application jar
